She is not an authorised user, but\u00a0I am, with a &#8220;<strong>genius<\/strong>&#8221; title (it means that for some hotels I can get extra discount). Everything was going well\u00a0till the moment when we found that I got\u00a0higher prices. The funniest\u00a0thing was that I saw an original price that was crossed out and a new lower price, but that\u00a0lower price was still much higher than the price that my girl-friend had.\u00a0Yes, you heard\u00a0me correctly, higher prices even with <strong>GENIUS<\/strong> account!<\/p>\n<p>I could not believe my eyes! So we checked several times all the options: the hotel, dates, number of nights. Everything was\u00a0correct and the same.<\/p>\n<p>I logged out. The prices became higher, that is correct. The question was still\u00a0open: why my girl-friend saw lower prices?<\/p>\n<p>I guessed that the reason could be browsing from different locations. I immediately decided to check it out and switch on the proxy.<\/p>\n<p>I was really impressed by results: depending on location you get different prices. Yes, for budget\u00a0hotels the difference is not so high, but let me show you an example with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.booking.com\/hotel\/mv\/anantara-kihavah-villas-maldives.html?checkin=2015-11-09&amp;checkout=2015-11-15\">luxury one<\/a>. Scroll down to the &#8220;<em>Three Bedroom Beach Pool Residence<\/em>&#8221;\u00a0and depending on location you&#8217;ll see these\u00a0prices:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2775\" src=\"https:\/\/stepansuvorov.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screenshot-2015-07-26-22.39.39.png\" alt=\"booking cheaters\" width=\"835\" height=\"339\" \/><\/p>\n<p>or these\u00a0prices:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2776\" src=\"https:\/\/stepansuvorov.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screenshot-2015-07-26-22.41.46.png\" alt=\"booking cheaters 2 \" width=\"735\" height=\"336\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Oh boy! The difference is almost <strong>20k euros<\/strong> after IP-address change!<\/p>\n<p>I played around with different locations (proxy servers) and got such consistency:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>US<\/strong> &#8211; cheap<\/li>\n<li><strong>Europe<\/strong>(Germany) &#8211; expensive<\/li>\n<li><strong>Eastern Europe<\/strong> (Romania, Ukraine) &#8211; cheap<\/li>\n<li><strong>Hong Kong<\/strong> &#8211; cheap<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So how to get best prices if you are booking from Europe? Just switch your IP address to one from the &#8220;cheap&#8221; zone.<\/p>\n<p><strong>P.S.:<\/strong> it works not for all the hotels.<\/p>\n<p><sub>the nice post illustration was taken from fightingidentitycrimes.com<\/sub><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I really hope there is another cause of doing what I\u00a0disclosed on booking.com, otherwise we can remove question mark from the title.
