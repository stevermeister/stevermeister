We can say that it was about everything and nothing(from tech side) the same time. He provided good structured way how everyone can grow as a professional inside AngularJS\/JavaScript(and probably not only) community.<\/p>\n<p>After several days\/weeks\/months\u00a0listeners could forget the\u00a0context, but they never forget awesome comparison that authors of frameworks and tools like builders who are constructing a bridge across the river, river of different development issues. And they know that these bridges would be used not only by them but mostly by juniors. So he wished us <em>create\u00a0our own bridges, help to improve\u00a0existing ones and never troll builders<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Very inspiring!

First part of the presentation for me was like &#8220;reading&#8221; documentation for component and explaining obvious things. Second part was more interesting with life coding and real example.

He presented his extension <a title=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ocombe\/ocLazyLoad\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ocombe\/ocLazyLoad\">ocLazyLoad<\/a> that allows to do lazy loading for modules in AngularJS. Pointed out how important lazy loading is, especially for mobile limited network connection. Also it was some explanation how it could work with router (both ngRoute and ui-router). It&#8217;s nice that ocLazyLoad also support dependancy injection for loaded modules.<\/p>\n<p>There are some expectations to get similar functionality in Angular1.5, we&#8217;ll see.<\/p>\n<p><strong>@Olivier<\/strong>, why only 20 min for such a fundamental concept? Already dived into the <a title=\"github.com\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ocombe\/ocLazyLoad\/blob\/master\/dist\/ocLazyLoad.js\">source code<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Visual Review &#8211; Automated GUI testing with Protractor<\/h2>\n<p><a class=\"ProfileHeaderCard-nameLink u-textInheritColor js-nav \" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dmarjenburgh\">Daniel Marjenburgh<\/a>\u00a0presented <a title=\"https:\/\/github.com\/xebia\/VisualReview\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/xebia\/VisualReview\">Visual Review<\/a> &#8211; tool to check visual changes between different project builds (btw name is terrible extremely difficult to google it :). The tool works together with protractor (thanks to special plugin <a title=\"https:\/\/github.com\/xebia\/VisualReview-protractor\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/xebia\/VisualReview-protractor\">VisualReview-protractor<\/a>) that makes it really tasty. The base idea is quite simple: to make and compare screenshots. In protractor scenario code it looks simply like:<\/p>\n<p>[javascript]<br \/>\nvr.takeScreenshot(&#8216;AngularJS-homepage&#8217;);<br \/>\n[\/javascript]<\/p>\n<p><strong>@Daniel<\/strong>, I liked the idea.

During all the presentation I had filling that backend developer wants to bring his concepts to client side(To be sure that I understood concept correctly I went to <a title=\"Angular model objects with JavaScript classes\" href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/opinionated-angularjs\/angular-model-objects-with-javascript-classes-2e6a067c73bc\">original article<\/a>). I was not convinced that I should try this approach. There were so many theoretical things that we ostensibly would be able to do with this structure(I even don&#8217;t remember the whole list): validation, relations, etc&#8230; I would like to see your implementation of this concepts. Because without implementation it&#8217;s nothing to discuss. In our applications\u00a0for data layer we are using <a title=\"https:\/\/github.com\/mgonto\/restangular\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/mgonto\/restangular\">Restangular<\/a> wrapped with our services where we do validation and all this stuff, and it works pretty well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>@Gert<\/strong>, if you have some code to share &#8211; please show it, I really would like to have a look.<\/p>\n<h2>How I made a mess of my Angular application (<a href=\"http:\/\/slides.com\/djsmith\/how-we-made-a-mess-of-our-angular-app\/#\/\">slides<\/a>, <a title=\"youtube.com\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=n8JdXkKhDyU&amp;feature=em-subs_digest\">video<\/a>)<\/h2>\n<p>Very funny speech by\u00a0<a class=\"ProfileHeaderCard-nameLink u-textInheritColor js-nav&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;\n\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/djsmith42\">Dave Smith<\/a>\u00a0about past Angular mistakes and\u00a0ruler punishment.
